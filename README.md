Unit 11 of college: create a dynamic web page that allows admins to manage teachers, students and courses and allow students to enroll in courses. 
CRUD functionality, form handling and asynchronous updates using Javascript fetch API.

Admin can add, update and delete teachers, students and courses
teachers can only see their timetable in the dashboard
Students can add the courses they are enrolled in.

FUll stack Project : 
Backend : Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (database) and Mongoose, RESTful routes for user registration, editing, deleting and course submission
Frontend : HTML, CSS, EJS(template engine) and Javascript(asynchronous fetch requests, table editing and dynamic form handling)

Error handling with try/catch statement sending appropriate Http status codes return JSON instead of redirecting use of findByIdAndUpdate with {new:true} to return the updated document -> ideal for client-side updates
